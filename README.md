# Apache JMeter Portable for PortableApps.com

<img src="App/AppInfo/appicon_128.png" align=left>

The [Apache JMeterâ„¢](https://jmeter.apache.org/) application is open source
software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional
behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing 
Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.
What can I do with it?

Apache JMeter may be used to test performance both on static and dynamic 
resources, Web dynamic applications. It can be used to simulate a heavy 
load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength
or to analyze overall performance under different load types.
